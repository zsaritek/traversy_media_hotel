I recently completed the Traversy Media CSS training on Udemy and found the projects to be incredibly valuable. I decided to replicate these projects myself, and in doing so, I gained a wealth of experience in using selectors with maximum efficiency.

Additionally, I delved into the various types of link definitions and discerned which ones were most applicable to each specific project. Learning how to make adjustments for optimal mobile viewing was another key takeaway.

Moreover, I acquired the skill of identifying which sites and links are best suited for incorporating icons. Interestingly, flex-box was not utilized in this project, providing an excellent opportunity to employ the float command more actively.

One particularly instructive aspect was the example of creating text on a background image and fine-tuning its opacity. This exercise provided a hands-on demonstration of these techniques and their practical applications.
